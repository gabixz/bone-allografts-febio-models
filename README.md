# bone-allografts-febio-models
This is a repository for the finite element models developped in FEBioStudio for the 29 bone allografts samples employed in the study.

All the files can be opened with FEBioStudio v.1.9.0. 

The boundary conditions corresponding to a 0.2% uniaxial compression, the homogenous linear elastic material properties Young's modulus E = 15 GPa, the Poisson's ratio nu = 0.3, and the solvers are identical for all the model files.
